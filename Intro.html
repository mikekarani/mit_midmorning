<p style="font-family: 'Source Code Pro', monospace;font-size: 24px">Once upon a time,in the animal kingdom there lived two friends,Metomio and Antonio.
  These two had been life long friends who at no given stage in their life had they gotten anything to fight over.During a certain period the GODS decided not shower them with the gift of the rain and so the land became so dry.
  All and sundry had to strive tyo survive on the little they had for they were not very prepared for the unforeseen calamity.The whole kingdom was squicky dry and the members turned the prophets as way to let out their frustrastions. </p>

<H4>HISTORY OF KENYA</H4>

<P STYLE="font-family:'Lobster', cursive;font-size:16px ;"
>Masai and Kikuyu: to the 19th century
  In the time before the arrival of outsiders and the beginning of recorded history, the Masai are the dominant tribe in the region now known as Kenya. They arrive as nomadic pastoralists from the north, probably in the mid-18th century. They are not Kenya's largest tribe (a distinction going to the Kikuyu, who live by agriculture), but the fierce reputation of the Masai warriors, engaging in frequent raids against their neighbours, gives them a power beyond their numbers.
  During the 19th century the region is penetrated by Arab traders in seach of ivory and by a couple of intrepid German missionaries. But Kenya's colonial future develops accidentally - as a result of events unfolding in Zanzibar in 1885.
  A German-British carve up: 1885-1886
  On 7 August 1885 five German warships steam into the lagoon of Zanzibar and train their guns on the sultan's palace. They have arrived with a demand from Bismarck that Sultan Barghash cede to the German emperor his mainland territories or face the consequences.
  But in the age of the telegram, gunboat diplomacy is no longer a local matter. This crisis is immediately on desks in London. Britain, eager not to offend Germany, suggests a compromise. The two nations should mutually agree spheres of interest over the territory stretching inland to the Great Lakes. This plan is accepted before August is out.

<h5> FIRST CAR COMPANY</h5>
<hr>

<P STYLE="font-family: 'Moon Dance', cursive;font-size: 30px">Even if you don’t know off the top of your head, you’d think the answer would be more or less forthcoming. At the very least, you can probably guess the decade—the 1880s seems likely. That’s when the Benz Patent-Motorwagen was introduced, after all.
  <img src="img/tx.jpeg" alt=""height="300"width="400">
But if you look beyond gasoline-powered internal combustion and start dabbling in, say, steam, the timeline gets pushed back decades. Steam wagons were plying roads in France in the 1870s, for example. Was a company formed to build such a contraption not, arguably, a car company?
  As with so many historical rabbit holes, the further you dig, the stranger, and more intriguing, things get—and the further back in time you have to travel to get a sense of where it all started. What I found when I started exploring the early history of the car will, if nothing else, make for great trivia for those post London-to-Brighton (or Lansing-to-Dearborn) Run drinking sessions. </P>
The embarrassed British consul finds himself under orders from London to persuade the sultan to sign an agreement ceding the lion's share of his mainland territory, with the details still to be decided. In September the German gunships begin their journey home. A joint Anglo-German boundary commission starts work in the interior.
By November 1886 the task is done and the result is agreed with the other main colonial power, France. The sultan is left a strip ten miles wide along the coast. Behind that a line is drawn to Mount Kilimanjaro and on to Lake Victoria at latitude 1° S. The British sphere of influence is to be to the north, the German to the south. The line remains to this day the border between Kenya and Tanzania.
